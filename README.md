This is a data pack, which adds unique skills to multiple weapons/equipments in the Void World version 3.7.X.
You can input "/function zhiling:reload" to initialize the functions.
After initialization, you can go to the function area in the Void Dimension to find the unique weapon merchants and exchange for weapons.
In the future, more unique skills for weapons/equipments will be updated.
